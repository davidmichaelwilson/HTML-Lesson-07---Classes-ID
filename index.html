		<h1>The CSS Box Model</h1>
		<p>We can declare widths and heights on elements to define their size. We also have other properties like margins, padding,
			and borders which make up the box model.</p>

		<!-- Start here for section one -->
		<section id="margin" class="bg-dark">
			<h2>Margin</h2>
			<p>Margin is used to control the space around an element.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- Section two -->
		<section id="padding" class="bg-light">
			<h2>Padding</h2>
			<p>Padding is a lot like margin, except that it adds the empty space <em>inside</em> the element, which includes it's background-color.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section three -->
  <section id="borders" class="bg-dark">
  <h2>Borders</h2>
  <p>Borders are a line that surrounds an element, similar to a stroke if you are familiar with design software.</p>
  </section>
